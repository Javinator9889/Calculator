# Calculator
A simple calculator using powerful Kotlin features

## How-to
### Build

First of all, clone this repository from Gitlab:
`git clone https://gitlab.javinator9889.com/Javinator9889/calculator.git`

Then, you will need to install Android Studio. You can achieve that from here: https://developer.android.com/studio
and open the project directly from the folder. You will notice that Android Studio starts
downloading and installing the necessary packages.

If you want to do any modification, navigate through the source code and edit any classes you need.
The app is entirely written in Kotlin, so you will need knowledge of this language.

Finally, build the application by using the "Build" option compile the debug version or the release 
one. If you would like to generate the APK for the latest one, keep in mind that you will need a 
signing key.
