/**
 * Main application activity. This class encapsulates the behaviour that must be shown
 * to the users. It consists on some different parts:
 *  - The {@link com.javinator9889.calculator.models.viewmodels.calculator.CalculatorViewModel CalculatorViewModel}
 *  which contains the application logic: it has relationships between buttons and actions that must
 *  take place.
 *  - The LifecycleScope part, responsible for launching coroutines for managing the input data and
 *  elements of the UI.
 *
 * When the activity is created, it waits until the lifecycle status has reached the CREATED one
 * before initializing some variables (such as {@literal lateinit var binder}) and start observing
 * the view models' live data.
